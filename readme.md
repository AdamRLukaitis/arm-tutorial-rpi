Raspberry-Pi Bare Metal Tutorial
================================

This repository contains the code for the Raspberry-Pi bare-metal programming
in C series. The home of the tutorial and all of the articles relating to the
code is at http://www.valvers.com/embedded-linux/raspberry-pi

You can build on linux, windows, or MAC - all you need is the arm-none-eabi
toolchain.

For all platforms, you can get the required toolchain used in this tutorial
from the https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded project - I recommend
getting the 4.7 toolchain because I've had problems with the 4.9 toolchain.

Have fun, and remember to experiment!
